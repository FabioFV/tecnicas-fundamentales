# Fundamental Techniques of Software Engineering

In this repository i have all laboratory assignments and project of Fundamental Techniques of Software Engineering class. Everything is written in Java.

### Laboratory Assignments

- Lab0. A simple program to calculate arithmetic average and standard deviation.
- Lab1. Console program to save students information and assignments.

### Project

The project consists of an application for record all the annotation of a tennis match between two individual players. The application must allow not only the record of the score, but the detail of the plays and also allow the reconstruction of the match, play by play.

The project have two parts:

- [Midterm] - (WORKING) In this part what matter is that the program "works". It's not mandatory to take into account the good practices, design patterns, software development life cycle, etc.
- [Final] - This part, basically, is for taking into account the good practices, design patterns and software development life cycle.
